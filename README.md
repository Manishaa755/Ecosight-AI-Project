# Ecosight: Image-to-Audio and Object Detection with Voice Output

Ecosight is a Python-based project designed to enhance accessibility and interaction with visual information. It offers two primary functionalities: converting the textual content of an image into spoken audio and detecting objects within an image, then announcing the names of these objects aloud. This tool can be particularly useful for visually impaired individuals or for applications requiring auditory feedback from visual data.

## Overview

Ecosight aims to bridge the gap between visual content and auditory understanding. It provides a dual-pronged approach:
1.  **Image-to-Audio Conversion:** Extracts text from an image (using Optical Character Recognition - OCR) and then converts this text into speech. This is useful for reading documents, signs, or any image containing text.
2.  **Object Detection with Audio Output:** Identifies various objects present in an image using a pre-trained object detection model and then verbalizes the names of the detected objects, providing an auditory description of the scene.

## Key Features

* **Image-to-Speech:** Converts text present in uploaded images into clear, spoken audio.
* **Object Recognition:** Detects multiple objects in an image.
* **Voice Output for Objects:** Announces the names of detected objects aloud.
* User-friendly interface (e.g., command-line or simple GUI).
* Modular design for easy extension.

## Technologies Used

*(Please update this section with the specific libraries and models you used)*

* **Python 3.x**
* **Image Processing:**
    * OpenCV (`cv2`): For image loading, preprocessing, and handling.
* **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):**
    * Tesseract OCR (via `pytesseract` or similar): For extracting text from images.
* **Object Detection:**
    * A pre-trained model like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), or Faster R-CNN.
    * Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Darknet (if using YOLO directly).
    * OpenCV's DNN module can also be used to run pre-trained models.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
    * `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech): For converting text to audio.
    * `pyttsx3`: An offline, cross-platform TTS library.
    * Other cloud-based TTS services (e.g., AWS Polly, Azure Cognitive Services Speech).
* **GUI (Optional):**
    * Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, or a web framework like Flask/Django if it's a web application.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ecosight.git](https://github.com/your-username/ecosight.git)
    cd ecosight
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary Python packages.
    ```
    # Example requirements.txt content:
    # opencv-python
    # pytesseract
    # gtts
    # pyttsx3
    # tensorflow # or torch, depending on your object detection model
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install Tesseract OCR (if using pytesseract):**
    * Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the [Tesseract GitHub page](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
    * You might need to configure the path to the Tesseract executable in your script.

5.  **Download Object Detection Model Files (if applicable):**
    * If you are using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO weights, config files, class names file), provide instructions on where to download them and place them within the project structure.
    * Example:
        ```
        # Download YOLOv3 weights (yolov3.weights), config (yolov3.cfg),
        # and class names (coco.names) and place them in a 'models/yolo' directory.
        ```

## Usage

*(Provide specific commands or steps to run your scripts)*

### Image to Audio Conversion

1.  Prepare an image file (e.g., `document.png`, `sign.jpg`) containing text.
2.  Run the image-to-audio script:
    ```bash
    python image_to_audio.py --image path/to/your/image.png
    ```
    *(Adjust command based on your script's arguments)*
3.  The script will process the image, extract text, convert it to speech, and typically save it as an audio file (e.g., `output.mp3`) or play it directly.

### Object Detection with Audio Output

1.  Prepare an image file (e.g., `scene.jpg`, `objects.png`).
2.  Run the object detection script:
    ```bash
    python object_detection_audio.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
    ```
    *(Adjust command based on your script's arguments)*
3.  The script will detect objects in the image and announce their names (e.g., "Detected objects are: person, car, dog"). It might also display the image with bounding boxes around detected objects.
